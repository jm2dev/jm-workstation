* Overview

My configuration files to work in an efficient way, or I think so :)

** emacs

My customizations to show line numbers, and use several modes for grails, groovy and XML development.

Recently I moved to [[http://overtone.github.io/emacs-live/][emacs live]], you can see my customizations [[https://github.com/jm2dev/emacs-live-jm-pack][here]].
** xrandr

Script to configure my dual display desktop.

** tmux

My nice tmux configuration, I forgot where I found it so credits are
owned. Copy the tmux.conf file to $HOME/.tmux.conf

** fedora

I need to customize my freebsd/debian version settings to work in
Fedora.

** i3

A tiling window manager, like xmonad. You need to copy *config* to
~/.i3/config.
** redshift

[[http://jonls.dk/redshift/][Redshift]] is an application to adjust the colour temperature of the screen. See my settings for London in that folder, and copy the file to ~/.config/redshift.conf.
