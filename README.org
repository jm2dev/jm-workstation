* Overview

My configuration files to work in an efficient way, or I think so :)

** emacs

My customizations to show line numbers, and use several modes for grails, groovy and XML development.

** xrandr

Script to configure my dual display desktop.

** tmux

My nice tmux configuration, I forgot where I found it so credits are
owned. Copy the tmux.conf file to $HOME/.tmux.conf

** fedora

I need to customize my freebsd/debian version settings to work in
Fedora.
